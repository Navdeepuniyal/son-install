# son-install

'son-install' provides a simple way to deploy, manage, upgrade and destroy the Sonata Service Plataform (SP) for specialized environments like Development, Integration, Qualification and Demonstration.

'son-install' is built of a set of Ansible playbooks to automate the deployment of infrastructure and applications. So, all that you need is a 'bash' shell with Ansible.
 
Actually 'son-install' v1.0 has a main playbook ('son-cmud.yml') invoked with external parameters to control the life-cycle of all the SP Services.
