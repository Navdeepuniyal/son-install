# son-install

'son-install' provides a simple way to deploy, manage, upgrade and destroy the Sonata Service Plataform (SP) for specialized environments like Development, Integration, Qualification and Demonstration.

'son-install' is built of a set of Ansible playbook to automate the deployment of infrastructure and applications. So, all that you need is a 'bash' sheel with Ansible.
 

## Development

Actually 'son-install-v1.0' has the following code structure:

* v01 - simple deployment of Sonata SP

* v02 - deployment of Sonata SP with extended CMUD functions to Create, Manage, Upgrade and Destroy
